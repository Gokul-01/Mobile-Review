            <h1>Samsung Galaxy Fold</h1>

            <br><br>
            <p>The Galaxy Fold is a science experiment, just one that you could theoretically buy. The purpose of any science experiment is to test a hypothesis. With the Fold, the hypothesis is that a flexible OLED screen could successfully turn into a consumer product. From that perspective, the experiment is a success because I can confirm that the hypothesis is false. Foldable screens aren’t ready yet.
                <br><br>
                But there’s another hypothesis Samsung has — perhaps inadvertently — proposed: a phone that’s bigger on the inside is actually a good idea.
                <br><br>
                Samsung’s other hardware changes involve keeping debris from getting into the hinge mechanism. There are plastic caps where the screen bends, tighter tolerances in the gaps around the hinge, and even the gap when the whole thing is closed is smaller now. Plus, if any debris does get into the hinge (which is what happened to my first review unit), there’s a metal layer between it and the screen.
                <br><br>
                Is all that enough? I don’t know. Nobody knows. People have definitely busted Galaxy Fold units since the rerelease. I didn’t bust mine in the few weeks that I had it, but I was also terrified that I would if I wasn’t careful. I didn’t go live in a bubble like Joanna Stern at The Wall Street Journal did, but I treated the thing tenderly and carefully — more so than anybody should have to with a phone, even one that costs $2,000.
                <br><br>
                Samsung is offering a one-time screen replacement within the first year for $150. That’s nice, I guess, but at this point, the only people buying the Fold are going to be the kinds of Samsung super-fans that are surely worth more than $150 to the company.
                <br><br>
                heThe Galaxy Fold forces you to make too many compromises. You have to compromise on durability, on having a phone you can fit in your pocket, and, most of all, on price. All of those compromises exist solely to get you the flexible screen, which is itself compromised because it still has that crease down the middle.
                <br><br>
                This got me thinking: what if instead of a crease down the middle, the screen was just split? You’d lose having a seamless canvas across which to splay a window, but you’d theoretically be getting rid of all those other compromises. A split-screen phone could be thinner, have a more pocketable shape, be more durable, and be cheaper.
                <br><br>
                There have been split-screen phones in the past, and there are even some coming out right now. The LG G8X is one example. If the software was good (by which I mean supported at the Android platform level), a dual-screen device could get you a lot of the benefits of the Galaxy Fold with fewer of the problems. You’d miss out on the futurism, but you’d get something more usable.
