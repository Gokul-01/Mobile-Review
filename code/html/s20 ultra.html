            <p>A flagship smartphone from any brand must go beyond the limits set by its predecessors, or its competitors. If it doesn’t, a big question mark hangs over not just the device, but over the person buying it as well. No doubt the Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra goes well beyond the limits set by its predecessors. In fact, it even reaches a comfortable parity with the best of the best in the Android cameraphone world. However, for the owner of a flagship, especially the costliest one, this is not enough. It needs to cross the borders of machine and reach into the man, eventually merging into the identity of the owner. In my opinion, after a long time, the Galaxy S20 Ultra has become that iconic S-series Samsung phone which will not only give you the feeling of owning something unique, it becomes an extension of your character as well. Of course, conditions apply. So, what does it feel like to own an iconic device that naturally comes attached with compromises? This is the review of the Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra.
                <br><br>
                In every Samsung Galaxy S-series commercial, the S20 Ultra is THE device that stands out. Primarily, because of the unique look made possible by the huge camera unit. It not only establishes the reason for someone to take a look at this device, it also establishes the fact that Samsung’s flagship innovations are no longer focused on the form factor, it’s the camera. This is why the S20 Ultra looks so iconic, with a very unique looking camera design attracting all you attention instead of the edge-to-edge beautiful AMOLED display. Anyone who looks at this device from the outside can easily recognise it as that Samsung phone from the airport billboard or a TV commercial.
                <br><br>
                Frankly, the design looks great because it looks sophisticated. There is a nice symmetry, there is a dual-tone finish and then there is the text, with quite a bold proclamation of “Space Zoom 100x”. Who wouldn’t want to brag about these things?
                <br><br>
                The Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra is all about the camera system. It boasts a super high resolution 108MP sensor on the main unit, an f1.8 aperture lens and OIS. It’s not just any sensor, measuring at 1/1.33-inch, it is one of the biggest in the cameraphone market right now. For comparison, the only sensor which is as big is in Huawei P40 Pro at 1/1.28-inch meanwhile the iPhone 11 Pro’s main sensor measures 1/2.55-inch. The S20 Ultra is big league not just in terms of sensor size, it is also currently the undisputed leader in resolution, a whopping 108 megapixels. If you think that’s crazy, the periscopic zoom camera unit at 48 megapixels makes Galaxy S20 Ultra the highest resolution cameraphone in the market, no other device comes close. Yes, there is OIS in this one too.
