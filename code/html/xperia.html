            <h1>Sony Xperia Z1</h1>
            <img src="https://fdn2.gsmarena.com/vv/pics/sony/sony-xperia-z1-4.jpg" alt="Sony Xperia Z1" height="100%" width="100%">
            <br><br>
            <p>The new handset builds on the success of the Xperia Z, with the same 5-inch display and similar metal frame and front-and-back glass design language.
                <br><br>
                It's even marginally bigger than the Xperia Z, an already hefty handset. The dimensions, for those who like stats, are: 144 x 74 x 8.5 mm. That's taller and wider than the Xperia Z, but a touch thinner. It's not light, either, at 170g.
                <br><br>
                But the benefit here is that the corners are smoother. The Z's edges were slightly sharp but this is much gentler so it makes it much more comfortable to hold. It's a more sumptuous, confident build quality than the Z.
                <br><br>
                It's still pretty big and those with small hands should probably look elsewhere or be prepared for pained hands caused by stretching fingers across the glass.
                <br><br>
                The aluminium frame is demure and understated – you barely notice it but for the carefully-detailed power button, the same as the one on the Xperia Z. And further down the right hand edge there's a new button, a dedicated camera shutter, hinting at the photographic focus of this phone.
                <br><br>
                The Z1 is available in three colours – white, black and purple. Black is the subtlest, white gleams and purple is gorgeous. Sony says the purple was arrived at because it's a combination of red which is warm and reassuring and blue, which is a colour that excites. Whatever, it's a very nice purple, which should be enough.
                <br><br>
                This is a well-built, beautifully styled handset. Only the iPhone 5 and HTC One better it in the design stakes.
                <br><br>
                The camera is one of the Z1's biggest advances. While most cameraphones offer 5MP or 8MP sensors, the latest models reach 13MP – or in the case of HTC opts for fewer but bigger pixels. There's one camera with 16MP, the Samsung Galaxy S4 Zoom. But Sony changes the game by shooting up to 20.7MP.
                <br><br>
                That means the only current phone with more pixels is the Nokia Lumia 1020. That has 41MP but is a thicker package.
                <br><br>
                Competition apart, Sony has worked to make this sensor and the aspherical lens array that goes with it. The result is a tremendously capable, powerful camera that is fast, responsive and delivers extremely good results.
                <br><br>
                It defaults to a Superior Auto setting which shoots at 8MP. This means the camera manages lossless zoom, that is, you can zoom in three times before the camera is unable to create an 8MP image. Of course, you can shoot at the full 20MP resolution by switching to Manual.
                <br><br>
                There's also the very cool Info Eye setting. You need a data connection for this but it allows you to photograph certain objects and see data associated with them. This means you can find out what that landmark building ahead of you is, or the vintage of the wine the sommelier has just brought you. It's simple to use and there's even a clever way to zoom in on just the bit of the scene you want it to recognise.
                <br><br>
                The Xperia Z1 has an even more powerful processor than the more-than-decent chip in the Xperia Z. It's powered by the quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 800 processor. It's a 2.2GHz model and as a result it's very speedy whether you're playing games, browsing the web or just, you know, opening emails.
                <br><br>
                Although it first launched with Android 4.2.2 Jelly Bean, Sony has done a stand-up job of keeping the operating system updated. As it stands, you're able to run Android 5.1.1 Lollipop smoothly on the Xperia Z1, which has enough modern features to keep you ticking over.
