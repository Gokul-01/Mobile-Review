                For $500 you can buy a smartphone with great performance (Pocophone F1), a nice design (Xiaomi Mi 9) or great battery life (Moto G7 Power). But you cannot buy one with a great camera. Until now. With the Pixel 3a Google has changed everything we thought we knew about midrangers. It’s a $400 smartphone with a camera superior to any iPhone. Yes, there are flaws, but read on to learn why Google has rewritten the rules for what we can expect on a budget of under $500.
                <br><br>
                Does the Pixel 3a look familiar? It should. At first glance, Google’s midranger is almost identical to its flagship Pixel 3. That means relatively chunky top and bottom bezels and a two-tone finish on the back, but whereas the Pixel 3 was criticised for this, the design is perfectly acceptable on a midrange phone.
                <br><br>
                Yes, there are compromises. The most obvious being Google has downgraded the glass backs to polycarbonate (goodbye wireless charging - more later) and the clear, loud dual stereo speakers of the Pixel 3 have been replaced by dual, loud not quite so clear stereo speakers on the Pixel 3a. But this price point (a phrase you will hear a lot throughout this review), there’s nothing out of place.
                <br><br>
                Moreover, the build quality is excellent. The polycarbonate body is actually grippier than glass and the colourful power buttons stand out from the crowd. There’s USB-C fast charging with a fast charger in the box (Dear Apple…) and, for many, this will be a deal maker: the Pixel 3a has an actual bonafide headphone jack.
                <br><br>
                the Pixel 3a doesn’t use Gorilla Glass (Dragontrail is cheaper but still durable) and displays are not quite as bright as those on the Pixel 3 line-up. But - being OLED - they still have perfect blacks and colours are rich, vibrant and better than almost anything you’ll find at this price point. The Pixel 3a has a slightly warmer tone than the Pixel 3a XL, so a hands-on may move you towards one way or the other.
