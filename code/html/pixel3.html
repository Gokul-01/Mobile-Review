                The Pixel 3 and Pixel 3 XL are Google phones. They swim in a sea of Google data and promise to use Google’s machine learning to make everything better: photos, annoying spam calls, even your “digital wellbeing.”
                <br><br>
                Google’s hardware division isn’t three years old yet, but the Pixel 3 is the third revision of its own smartphone. Google making its own hardware is no longer a novelty, and at this point, there’s been enough time for us to get a sense of its priorities and design.
                <br><br>
                But very few people buy a phone because it’s a physical manifestation of a software company’s vision of the future. They buy a phone because they want a good phone — something with a nice screen, an excellent camera, good battery life. You know, “phone stuff.”
                <br><br>
                More than anything else, that’s what I think Google focused on this year: improving the “phone stuff.” The Pixel 3 and 3 XL are superb phones that attempt to address nearly all of the complaints people had about last year’s Pixels.
                <br><br>
                For three years now, the Pixel phones have claimed the mantle of “best Android phone,” but they’ve always done so with asterisks. Those asterisks involved bezels, screen quality, or some other thing. This year, Google aims to claim the mantle again with the Pixel 3 and 3 XL, minus the asterisks.
                <br><br>
                will talk about the notch on the Pixel 3 XL, I promise. But not yet, because it’s not the most important part of looking at this phone. Instead, the single biggest improvement this year on both sizes is the quality of the screens. The screens are great.
                <br><br>
                Both phone sizes use OLED displays, which gets you all the usual benefits of that screen technology: deep blacks, lower power consumption, and curved corners. But as we learned last year with the Pixel 2 XL, it’s all too easy to make an OLED screen that looks bad. The Pixel 2 XL screen was muddy, reds looked more like browns, and it felt like there was a layer of parchment paper making everything hazy. There was also a burn-in scare at launch that caused a whole lot of drama.
                <br><br>
                I obviously can’t speak to burn-in yet, but the color problems are 100 percent gone this year. The Pixel 3 XL’s screen is vibrant and bright with colors that pop at any viewing angle. Google says that it spent a lot of time ensuring the quality of these screens this year from every perspective, including longevity, color accuracy, and brightness.
                <br><br>
                Google is defaulting to a new color mode called “adaptive,” which significantly increases the vibrancy of most colors without making human skin tones look surreal. It doesn’t quite take the colors to Samsung levels of garishness, but it can feel a little dramatic in the purples and the reds. I’ve decided to leave it on, but if you prefer a more muted look, there are also profiles for “Natural” (sRGB calibrated) and “Boosted” (sRGB + 10 percent saturation).
                <br><br>
                I also can’t detect a significant difference in screen quality between the Pixel 3 and the Pixel 3 XL. Both are excellent, and though they don’t quite match the brightness and color gamut of the iPhone XS or Galaxy S9, they’re finally worthy of the high prices that Pixel phones command.
                <br><br>
                I also like that the screens are bigger on both phones without making the bodies bigger, thanks to reduced bezels and taller aspect ratios. It makes the smaller Pixel 3 finally feel like a top-tier device and much less of a compromise. On the larger Pixel 3 XL, the screen is bigger primarily because it’s been extended to the top corners, resulting in a chin and a notch.
