            <p>With every subsequent release, Nokia has found a way to unify their design language while also focussing on creating a uniquely identifiable product. The Nokia 8.1 continues this tradition and is perhaps one of the best looking phones of 2018. Seriously, the Nokia 8.1 is downright gorgeous.
                <br><br>
                The front of the phone is a bit plain looking with a 6.18 inch display taking up most of the space. The screen does have a notch cut out and honestly, we’ve gotten used to it. What I still don’t like is Nokia’s habit of placing their brand name on the chin of the phone. It takes away from the clean look of the phone and with the brand name already emblazoned at the rear, just seems a bit much.
                <br><br>
                Like most modern phones, the Nokia 8.1 is also a glass and metal sandwich.  The central frame is made of extruded series 6000 aluminium. What really lifts the design though is the way the glass merges into the dual anodized edges. A matte finish right around the edges beautifully graduates to a shiny silver frame. Really, Nokia has done a delightful job here and the design looks great. The gently curved edges go a long way in ensuring that the phone fits well in the hand. The bottom edge has a Type C port while at the top is a 3.5mm audio jack.
                <br><br>
                The back of the phone has a dual camera module towards the top with a fingerprint sensor below it. Towards the left lies the LED flash. The entire back is made of glass and has a very premium finish to it. An unfortunate side effect of this, however, is that the phone is ridiculously slippery. On more than one occassion, the phone slipped off the chair on which we’d kept it. You’ll have to be careful with this one!
                <br><br>
                Like every other Nokia phones, the 8.1 is pretty straightforward when it comes to software. Part of the Android One initiative, the phone is running Android 9.0 with the November security patch on board.
