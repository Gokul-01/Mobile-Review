            <p>No there is no single definition for the “pro” that everyone uses as a tag on their phones’ boxes. It could mean anything in the mid range, but when it comes to flagship devices, the “Pro” tag is definitely meant to target the professional. Increased productivity is the goal here. Can we do everything we do on the phone, fast and quick? Because, for a professional, the phone needs to get out of the way, not stand in the way. So now the question becomes, which is the best “Pro” device in the market that lets you do this? Enter the 10th generation of a device that pretty much created this segment – the Samsung Galaxy Note 10+. It’s built for the creative professional and is geared towards productivity. Has Samsung perfected the Pro device? Let’s find out in the review.
                <br><br>
                The Samsung Galaxy Note 10+ is an absolute stunner when it comes to design. Take it from me, this is by no means an exaggeration and you will agree with me once you take a look at it in person. It is, honestly, one of the most futuristic pieces of slabs I’ve come across in recent times. There are reasons why it evokes such a reaction. First, the boxy shape is a departure from the curved corners that we have been used to, in other phones including Samsung’s own. This design brings a feel of solidity just through looks and then the organic feel is brought in with the curved screen that just melts on the sides. Eventhough this is nothing new for Samsung, there is something unique about the combination of sharp corners and the curved glass edge screen AND yes, the thinnest bezels I have seen in an Android smartphone. Absolute stunner is by no means an exaggeration.

                The materials used are metal and glass, as we would expect from a premium flagship device. The top and the bottom parts of the Note 10+ are flat which is the exact opposite of how the phone is built on its sides. This kind of a design evokes a bit of nostalgia, as it reminded me a bit of the N8 which had a flat top and bottom with curved sides, then the N9 and the Lumia 800. All from Nokia, once the masters of phone design. It is wonderful to see this aesthetic in the Galaxy Note 10+, a truly unique direction that hopefully continues after the 10th generation of this series. Might as well add that the mechanism for accessing the S-Pen is also well designed and built, with the S-Pen itself feeling really sturdy. I have used a lot of styluses and this one’s easily right there among the best when it comes to design and built quality. More on the S-Pen later.

                This year, I’m sure you’ve heard, there are two Note 10s. The Note 10+ is at 6.8 inches, a good 0.5 inches (12.77mm) in diagonal more than the smaller Note 10. Another key difference in the display is the resolution, which is rated at Quad HD+ for the Note 10+ while the Note 10 will stick to a full HD one. If you have previously used ANY display from Samsung’s flagship S series or Note series, you can guess how great the display is already. But for the benefit of new users, let me just say, the display is wow. Not just wow, but Infinity wow. First and foremost, the thinnest bezels I’ve seen on any smartphone. This makes the display look like a razor thin-bezel high end TV from Samsung. The curved edges make it even better, making the display look like it doesn’t even have bezels on the sides when you look at it from the front. And then there is the new Infinity-O design which, even when it is bang right in the middle of the screen, manages to easily vanish amidst content.
                <br><br>
                498 PPI is no small matter. This is not only the crispiest screen you’ll use but also the most vivid one, with HDR10+. It is seriously like a new generation TV in your hands when you start watching content, just unbelievably bright, colorful, crisp and all the adjectives that you would associate with a great display that has an almost perfect viewing experience. But with such a big display, the concern of phone size is valid. It’s a big phone, even for my big hands but thanks to OneUI, Samsung’s latest well-designed custom skin over Android, all the UI controls are well within reach. In my time with the device, I watched a lot of video which is why I keep repeating it is a TV-like experience in your hands. With one of the loudest but not necessarily the highest quality speakers I’ve heard on a flagship, even group watch sessions were possible. Almost everyone I showed the phone were awestruck with how great the display was. Safe to say, with the Note 10+ you will be carrying a Infinity TV in your hands and that’s great if you are into multimedia consumption like me.
