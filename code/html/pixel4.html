            <p>Google is touting face unlock as being super fast and it is, though on a technical level I think that the actual registering and unlocking is the same speed as on the iPhone. The reason the Pixel’s face unlock feels so fast is that when you pick up the phone, it simply jumps right into what you were doing before without requiring you to tap or swipe on the screen at all. (You can change this with a setting.
                <br><br>
                Motion Sense is based on a technology Google has been developing for years called Project Soli. It’s radar on your phone, literally, and in theory it could enable incredibly interesting ways to interact with software. It can apparently detect movement as subtle as the flutter of a butterfly wing, and potentially even your heartbeat.
                <br><br>
                You can wave at or pet five different Pokémon on custom wallpapers using Motion Sense.
                It could do all that, but in this very first use of the technology, it does not. Google has only chosen to implement three types of movements for Motion Sense to detect, and they’re all very broad gestures.
                <br><br>
                The most obvious way Motion Sense is being used on the Pixel 4 is to let you wave your hand above the screen to skip tracks when music is playing. And, unfortunately, this feature is the flakiest. I’ve figured out that it works best when the phone is sitting flat on the table. It can only read swipes that are perpendicular to the top of the Pixel, where you’ll see a very subtle light bar at the top of the screen that serves as the only visual indicator that you’re doing it right.
                <br><br>
                Once I figured out that it requires a clean sweep across the entire top of the phone, though, I really liked using it. As I’m sitting here right now typing on my laptop, I can simply swing my left hand out quickly to skip tracks without having to look for the right button.
                <br><br>
                The second thing Motion Sense does is detect your presence. The radar forms a bubble over the phone, and if you move outside it, the always-on display turns off.
                <br><br>
                Lastly, the third and best thing Motion Sense can do is tell if you’re reaching for the phone. As your hand approaches, the phone can react and start doing something before you grab it.
                <br><br>
                It works on ringtones and alarms. When one of them goes off and you reach for the phone to see what’s up, it immediately quiets the phone down a little. Then you can swipe to mute the ringtone or snooze the alarm.
                <br><br>
                Reach detection does one more thing — it lights up the face unlock sensors right away, so it can look for your face right away and unlock just that much faster. It’s maybe a half a beat faster than the iPhone’s accelerometer-based method.
                <br><br>
                All of these use cases are really small moments of removing just the tiniest amount of friction, and you could argue they are all unnecessary. Still, it’s less annoying to groggily fling your hand over the phone than it is to pick the thing up and fumble for the right spot on the touchscreen to silence an alarm.
                <br><br>
                There’s also a Pokémon wallpaper that lets you wave at or pet Pokémon. It shows current weather conditions and the Pokemon go to sleep at night. Yes, I have rearranged my entire home screen to properly frame Eevee.
