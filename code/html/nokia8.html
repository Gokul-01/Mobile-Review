            <p>Sirocco is no wind of change and rushing things is not really the Mediterranean way. It makes perfect sense then that the Nokia 8 Sirocco comes out with last year's chipset and what's now considered an old-school 16:9 aspect display. That's everything old about it though - well, that and, obviously, the name lifted off of one of the special editions Nokia 8800s from the mid-noughties.
                <br><br>
                The Nokia 8 Sirocco is more than a little different from the plain 8 that's been out for some 8 months now. A dual-curved 5.5-inch OLED display replaces the 5.3-inch LCD and that comes in an IP67 certified all-glass body, compared to the 8's aluminum backed construction with an IP54 rating.
                <br><br>
                A new camera setup now includes a large dual pixel primary 12MP sensor in place of the smaller 13MP one on the Nokia 8, and what was a monochrome camera on the 8 is now a telephoto instead. The combo should be mostly the same as the one found on the 7 Plus, but with OIS added in the mix. One could see it as a downgrade that the 8 Sirocco's front camera can't record 2160p videos (the one on the vanilla 8 can), but this 5MP selfie shooter's large pixels promise better low-light images.
                <br><br>
                A minor bump in battery capacity means the Sirocco comes with a 3,260mAh cell instead of the 8's 3,090mAh, but the extra capacity has eaten up the room for a microSD slot. Or the two are entirely unrelated - either way, the internal storage (an otherwise roomy 128GB) is not expandable.
